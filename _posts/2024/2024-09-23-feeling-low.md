Not sure where to start this. It might be the first time I've admitted out loud to *anyone* that I'm starting to have a rough go of things.

First, I quit my well-paid job because I was basically being forced out. I really like the work, and the poeple I did it with, just not at all the people I did it **for**. At the time, I was getting callbacks on applications, interviews, and things seemed to be temporary. I think at the exact time I quit, jobs dried up. No more callbacks, no more interviews. I feel very useless and it's starting to scare me.
