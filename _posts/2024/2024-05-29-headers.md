I read an article once about headers. It really resonated with me, and I try to hold to what I read. It was when researching lightweight css frameworks that I stumbled on [Tufte css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).

## The gist
The theme is "no more than what's necessary." Use a H1 for titles, H2 for sections, and H3 for subheadings *only if necessary*.

The bottom line is this: if you need more than an H3, you probably should consider rewriting your document. It just isn't necessary.
